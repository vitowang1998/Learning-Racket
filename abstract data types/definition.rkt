;; Abstract Data Type (ADT)
;; Many sources share the same view on the definition of abstract data type.
;; They consider an abstract data type is defined by its behaviours.
;; In essence, an abstract data type is the essence of the data it represents.
;; And the vaious ways of implementing this abstract data type are the coresponding data strctures for it.

;; In some sense, we are simulating the machine-level interactions of programs.
